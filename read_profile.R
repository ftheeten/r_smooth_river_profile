## Set up the size of the basis functions/number of knots
k <- 20
## This fits the unconstrained model but gets us smoothness parameters that
## that we will need later
unc <- gam(y ~ s(x, k = k, bs = "cr"), data = df2)

## This creates the cubic spline basis functions of `x`
## It returns an object containing the penalty matrix for the spline
## among other things; see ?smooth.construct for description of each
## element in the returned object
sm <- smoothCon(s(x, k = k, bs = "cr"), df2, knots = NULL)[[1]]

## This gets the constraint matrix and constraint vector that imposes
## linear constraints to enforce montonicity on a cubic regression spline
## the key thing you need to change is `up`.
## `up = TRUE` == increasing function
## `up = FALSE` == decreasing function (as per your example)
## `xp` is a vector of knot locations that we get back from smoothCon
F <- mono.con(sm$xp, up = TRUE)   # get constraints: up = FALSE == Decreasing constraint!

## Fill in G, the object pcsl needs to fit; this is just what `pcls` says it needs:
## X is the model matrix (of the basis functions)
## C is the identifiability constraints - no constraints needed here
##   for the single smooth
## sp are the smoothness parameters from the unconstrained GAM
## p/xp are the knot locations again, but negated for a decreasing function
## y is the response data
## w are weights and this is fancy code for a vector of 1s of length(y)
